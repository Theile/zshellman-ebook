# Namespaces {#namespaces}

Namespaces are semantic categories to hold related items together. *Folders* play the same role in keeping related *files* together on a *file system*. If you have a background of Java, C# or other OOP languages then working with shellman is a piece of cake for you.

There is a length limitation to namespaces in a snippet so some of them doesn't exist under exact namespace I write in this book. Fortunately they are few.

It happens when a single snippet is not enough to do the job and a function is needed. Such functions are available in `Shellman`. See [lib](#lib-fn-fx) for more information.
